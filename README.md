## Installation

### Step 1: Set up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project. To set up a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment** by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. For more detailed guidance on virtual environments, refer to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

### Step 2: Install Requirements

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.



## Configuration (optional)

This project requires certain environment variables to be set up in a `.env` file to function correctly. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and include the following information:

```plaintext
SCHOOL=your_school_name
USERNAME=your_username
PASSWORD=your_password
```
Ensure that your `.env` file is securely stored and not shared publicly. You may want to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control.


## Usage

This tool uses command-line arguments to specify the video or folder URL to download, as well as user credentials and configuration options. The following arguments are supported:

### Arguments:

- **`url`** (required): The URL of the video or folder you want to download.
- **`-u`, `--user`** (optional): The username required for authentication (if the service requires login).
- **`-p`, `--password`** (optional): The password for the specified username. If the `-u` (username) argument is provided, the `-p` (password) argument is required.
- **`-s`, `--school`** (optional): The university or school name for matching. This is required if the `-u` (username) is provided.
- **`-d`, `--dir`** (optional, default: `downloads`): The directory where the videos will be downloaded. If not provided, the default directory is `downloads`.
- **`--debug`** (optional): Run the browser in non-headless mode, showing the browser window (useful for debugging).

### Example Usage

To download a video or folder, run the following command with the required URL:

```bash
python main.py <url>
```

**Example 1**: Download a video with no user credentials (headless mode enabled by default):

```bash
python main.py https://example.com/video
```

**Example 2**: Download a video with user credentials provided via CLI:

```bash
python main.py https://example.com/video -u your_username -p your_password -s your_school
```

**Example 3**: Download a video with a specific directory and enabling the browser window:

```bash
python main.py https://example.com/video -d /path/to/downloads --debug
```

### Key Notes:
- values for `--user`, `--password` and `--school`can be set using the `.env` file as described above.

- **`--user` and `--password`**: If you provide a username using `--user`, you **must** also provide the corresponding password using `--password`.
- **`--school`**: This argument should be used along with `--user` to specify the associated university or school name for authentication.
